Before some days VMware released the [VMware Virtual SAN 6.1 Streched Cluster Bandwidth Sizin Guidance](http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/products/vsan/vmware-virtual-san-6.1-stretched-cluster-bandwidth-sizing.pdf) document. This document explains how to size bandwidth requirements for Virtual SAN in Stretched Cluster configurations.

Virtual SAN Stretched Cluster configurations can be spread across distances, provided bandwidth and latency requirements are met.

> This document only covers the Virtual SAN network bandwidth requirements.

![VMworld Begins with YOU!](/ibm-vmworld2.jpeg)

Yesterday was one of these days of the year that you have to wake up really early but full of energy, until you reach the airport :) So excited joining VMworld 2018 in Barcelona for 2nd time.

At least this year I was traveling with my friend and colleague Nedin Ametovski so I had company during the long way. Day started really tough as we had to wake up around 4:30 prepare the last minute stuff (toothbrushes, chargers etc) in order to head to the train station and get into the train that will lead us to Prague's main train station. During that time actually I felt quite productive as I finished my blog post for vRealize Log Insight and had some really interesting discussion with my mate. From there a little bit of walking and jump into the shuttle bus for the airport. Weather was kind of foggy and cold (classic Czech Republic weather).

After the normal stuff, drop-off baggage (I will try not to comment here about Czech Airlines) and security check finally we get into the airplane and head to Barcelona. Flight was quite good (not comfy though) but by mistake I was sitting next to another 2 IBM colleagues from Prague and Helsinki which they were going as well to VMworld (this is what I like about VMworld, networking and conversations). We had some really nice conversation and the time passed quite fast.

As it says the title **"VMworld Begins with YOU"** and this is something that I strongly believe about VMworld, is my second time here and already I feel the different vibes around people that they are open to have a conversation, have a coffee and share their thoughts on anything around technology.

After the arrival on Barcelona's airport we headed straight to Fira Gran Via in order to do the registration and to take our badge in order to save some time from the crowded Monday morning. (Special thanks to all the VMworld people working for this event that they have every year Shuttle buses from Airport to Fira Gran Via, is really helpfull).

Next stop hotel to get a sleep, rest and prepare to meet some IBMers to a restaurant nearby for a stressless dinner and speak with people that until today we only spoke through work and projects but didn't had the chance to meet in person. I was quite amazed with how many people I have worked with but never had the chance to meet and this is the reason of VMworld most of the times, bring people together.

After a delightful dinner, many interesting conversations and a lot of fun we took an IBM family photo and went back to the hotel for a proper rest!!! Glad to working with all these folks, and with the people that didn't until now at least I had the chance to meet them tonight.

Buenas noches Barcelona!

![vExpert-2018](/vexpert-2018.jpeg)

Today VMware announced once again the results of the [VMware vExpert](https://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2018/03/vexpert-2018-award-announcement.html) Program. I would like to say that I am honored to be named for 3 years in a row and thank you very much to all of my supporters.

Special thanks to VMware for bringing this program every year with many many benefits and of course to our Community guy [Corey Romero](https://twitter.com/vCommunityGuy) for all the work that all of us know he is doing.

Have a nice day!

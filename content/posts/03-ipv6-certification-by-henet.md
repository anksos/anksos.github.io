After a lot of hours of playing around with my IPv6 certification finally i finished it.. (almost) Only the daily jobs left but it's something easy and now i am writing the script for these daily jobs so when i finish it i will post it here. The certification was really cool and pretty good for education purposes. I learned things that i haven't see them before in practice so i enjoy it a lot. The all things you have to do to pass it is:

- Prove that you have IPv6 connectivity
- Prove that you have a working IPv6 web server
- Prove that you have a working IPv6 email address
- Prove that you have working forward IPv6 DNS
- Prove that you have working reverse IPv6 DNS for your mail server
- Prove that you have name servers with IPv6 addresses that can respond to queries via IPv6
- Prove your knowledge of IPv6 technologies through quick and easy testing

You will also demonstrate that you are familiar with IPv6 concepts such as:

- the format of IPv6 addresses
- AAAA records
- reverse DNS for IPv6
- the IPv6 localhost address
- the IPv6 default route
- the IPv6 documentation prefix
- the IPv6 link local prefix
- the IPv6 multicast prefix
- how to do an IPv6 ping
- how to do an IPv6 traceroute
- common IPv6 prefix lengths such as /64, /48, /32
- and more!

as the site says.. if you are familiar with all these things or you know the basics and you want to participate, just visit the Hurricane Electric and do the [Certification](http://ipv6.he.net/certification/index.php).

My certificate:

Anyway, it's a very good challenge and opportunity for professional network administrators to change their server to full IPv6 support and for newbies to learn more things about IPv6 and server side stuff.

Hope you enjoy it...

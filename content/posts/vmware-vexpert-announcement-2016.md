Hello,

I wanted to share with you that I am listed as a vExpert for 2016. This is my first year as a vExpert and I will try hard not to be the last. A big journey starts for me now and I would like to thank the vExpert community, the people that follow my blog/twitter  and the judges for considering my contribution and listed me as vExpert for 2016.

[Here](https://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2016/02/vexpert-2016-award-announcement.html) you can found the official announcement from VMware about the vExpert 2016 Award.

Some things on what is the vExpert program (from the site):

> The VMware vExpert program is VMware’s global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware’s marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware’s roadmap. VMware will provide you with a unique vExpert id that will allow insights into analytics to help understand customer trends to assist you and keep your advocacy activities on track.

vExpert is one of the biggest technical community recognition program from VMware. This program is popular for the recognition it holds in the industry, and many benefits it offers for the members – including software beta testing, blogger briefings, privileged access to events and wonderful gifts. Looking forward to this year’s attractions.

Thank you again.
